TransformersPHP is designed to be functionally equivalent to the Python library, while still maintaining the same level
of performance and ease of use. This library is built on top of the Hugging Face's Transformers library, which provides
thousands of pre-trained models in 100+ languages. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use library for PHP
developers using a similar API to the Python library. These models can be used for a variety of tasks, including text
generation, summarization, translation, and more.

TransformersPHP uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run the models, which is a high-performance scoring
engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models. You can easily convert any PyTorch or TensorFlow model to ONNX
and use it with TransformersPHP using [🤗 Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime).

TO learn more about the library and how it works, head over to
our [extensive documentation](https://codewithkyrian.github.io/transformers-php/introduction).

## Quick tour

Because TransformersPHP is designed to be functionally equivalent to the Python library, it's super easy to learn from
existing Python or Javascript code. We provide the `pipeline` API, which is a high-level, easy-to-use API that groups
together a model with its necessary preprocessing and postprocessing steps.

<table>
<tr>

<th align="center"><b>Python (original)</b></th>
<th align="center"><b>PHP (ours)</b></th>
<th align="center"><b>Javascript (Xenova)</b></th>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

out = pipe('I love transformers!')
# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}]
```

</td>
<td>

```php
use function Codewithkyrian\Transformers\Pipelines\pipeline;

// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
$pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis');

$out = $pipe('I love transformers!');
// [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999808732}]
```

</td>
<td>

```javascript
import {pipeline} from '@xenova/transformers';

// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis');

let out = await pipe('I love transformers!');
// [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}]
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function.
For example:

```php
use function Codewithkyrian\Transformers\Pipelines\pipeline;

// Allocate a pipeline for translation
$pipe = pipeline('translation', 'Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english');

```

## Installation

You can install the library via Composer. This is the recommended way to install the library.

```bash
composer require codewithkyrian/transformers
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The ONNX library is platform-specific, so it's important to run the composer require command on the target platform
> where the code will be executed. In most cases, this will be your development machine or a server where you deploy
> your application, but if you're using a Docker container, run the `composer require` command inside that container.

## PHP FFI Extension

TransformersPHP uses the PHP FFI extension to interact with the ONNX runtime. The FFI extension is included by default
in PHP 7.4 and later, but it may not be enabled by default. If the FFI extension is not enabled, you can enable it by
uncommenting(remove the `;` from the beginning of the line) the
following line in your `php.ini` file:

```ini
extension = ffi
```

Also, you need to set the `ffi.enable` directive to `true` in your `php.ini` file:

```ini
ffi.enable = true
```

After making these changes, restart your web server or PHP-FPM service, and you should be good to go.

## Documentation

For more detailed information on how to use the library, check out the
documentation : [https://codewithkyrian.github.io/transformers-php](https://codewithkyrian.github.io/transformers-php)

## Usage

By default, TransformersPHP uses hosted pretrained ONNX models. For supported tasks, models that have been converted to
work with [Xenova's Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js) on HuggingFace should work
out of the box with TransformersPHP.

## Configuration

You can configure the behaviour of the TransformersPHP library as follows:

```php
use Codewithkyrian\Transformers\Transformers;

Transformers::setup()
    ->setCacheDir('...') // Set the default cache directory for transformers models. Defaults to `.transformers-cache/models`
    ->setRemoteHost('...') // Set the remote host for downloading models. Defaults to `https://huggingface.co`
    ->setRemotePathTemplate('...') // Set the remote path template for downloading models. Defaults to `{model}/resolve/{revision}/{file}`
    ->setAuthToken('...') // Set the auth token for downloading models. Defaults to `null`
    ->setUserAgent('...') // Set the user agent for downloading models. Defaults to `transformers-php/{version}`
    ->setImageDriver('...') // Set the image driver for processing images. Defaults to `IMAGICK'
    ->setLogger('...'); // Set the logger for TransformersPHP. Defaults to `null`
```

You can call the `set` methods in any order, or leave any out entirely, in which case, it uses the default values. For
more information on the configuration options and what they mean, checkout
the [documentation](https://codewithkyrian.github.io/transformers-php/configuration).

## Convert your models to ONNX

TransformersPHP only works with ONNX models, therefore, you must convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow or JAX models to
ONNX. It is recommended to use [🤗 Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) to perform the conversion and
quantization of your model.

## Pre-Download Models

By default, TransformersPHP automatically retrieves model weights (ONNX format) from the Hugging Face model hub when
you first use a pipeline or pretrained model. This can lead to a slight delay during the initial use. To improve the
user experience, it's recommended to pre-download the models you intend to use before running them in your PHP
application, especially for larger models. One way to do that is run the request once manually, but TransformersPHP
also comes with a command line tool to help you do just that:

```bash
./vendor/bin/transformers download <model_identifier> [<task>] [options]
```

Explanation of Arguments:

- **<model_identifier>**: This specifies the model you want to download. You can find model identifiers by browsing the
  Hugging Face model hub (https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js).
- **[\<task\>]**: (Optional) This parameter allows for downloading task-specific configurations and weights. This can be
  helpful if you know the specific task you'll be using the model for (e.g., "text2text-generation").
- **[options]**: (Optional) You can further customize the download process with additional options:
    - **--cache_dir=\<directory\>**: Specify a directory to store downloaded models (defaults to the configured cache).
      You can
      use -c as a shortcut in the command.
    - **--quantized=\<true|false\>**: Download the quantized model version if available (defaults to true). Quantized
      models are
      smaller and faster, but may have slightly lower accuracy. Use -q as a shortcut in the command.

> [!CAUTION]
> Remember to add your cache directory to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing the downloaded models to your git
> repository.
